# Work Day Scheduler

For this assignment I created a scheduling application. 

- In this application users are able to see time slots for availble times during the work day.

- At the top of the webpage the current date is displayed.

- Times will become grey as the time slot shows a past time. 

- The current hour time slot will display red.

- The future time slots for hours that day will show green.

- Users will be able to enter information to each time slot and save it to local storage.
